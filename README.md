## 🎯 Project Goal

**IMPORTANT: WE'RE NOT FOR PROFIT.**
\
Majority of the features provided, will be of no cost. We're going to prioritize banner ads as we progress as a client, with no pop-up/in-stream ads. Just ads sitting on the launcher screen.

I'm aiming to add everything that someone would usually expect within a professional client and launcher (e.g. Lunar/Badlion), but mostly for free. Monetization in this project would only be through launcher banner ads, cosmetics, and possibly a subscription in the future. There will be no in-game paid features except a few Cosmetics, the rest of the features will be free. I'm also aiming to make it more customizable and add more creative features that probably aren't in the popular clients we use day-to-day. I'm a person who appreciates feedback, and I'm all for listening to what the people want. Feel free to suggest.

## 🗃️ Project Status

This project is still under development, and isn't accessible by the public. Once it is, it will be the first revamped Leaf Client Beta version.
